## Downloading MNIST files
We use the parquet files provided by huggingface at [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ylecun/mnist/tree/main/mnist). Download both the train and test files from the link, then put them into a folder named `data`. Your directory should thus be structured as follows:

```
zkpot
|-- data
|   |-- train.parquet
|   |-- test.parquet 
|-- src
|
...
```
